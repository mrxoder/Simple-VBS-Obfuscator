## Simple VBS Obfuscator
While investigating a Windows malware infection, 
I encountered an obfuscated VBS payload. 
I reverse-engineered the obfuscation algorithm and 
then attempted to recreate the Python script used to obfuscate the VBS payload.

``Usage:  vbs_obf.py input_vbs_filename   output_vbs_filename``
